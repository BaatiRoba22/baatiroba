pandas
  ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load your data
   df = pd.read_csv('yourfile.csv')

   # Compute basic statistics
   statistics = df.describe()
   print(statistics)
   ```

2. Performing Groupings:
   You can group your data by a categorical column and compute the mean of a numerical column for each group. 

   Example:
   ```python
   # Group by a categorical column (e.g., 'species') and compute the mean of a numerical column (e.g., 'sepal_length')
   grouped_data = df.groupby('species')['sepal_length'].mean()
   print(grouped_data)
   ```

3. Identifying Patterns:
   After computing the statistics and groupings, look for trends or patterns. For example, you might notice that one species has a significantly higher average sepal length compared to others.

4. Visualizing Results:
   To visualize your findings, you can use Matplotlib. For instance, you can create a bar plot to show the mean values for each group.

   Example:
   ```python
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

   # Bar plot of the grouped data
   grouped_data.plot(kind='bar')
   plt.title('Mean Sepal Length by Species')
   plt.xlabel('Species')
   plt.ylabel('Mean Sepal Length')
   plt.show()
   ```
